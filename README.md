Valhalla: Client
================

Old Norse poems depict Valhalla as being thatched with shields and spears and guarded by wolves and eagles. It’s a place of perpetual fighting, presumably with the intention of sharpening the skills of the warriors for their battle against Fenrir. After any scuffle in Valhalla, the warriors emerge healed to sit together around the hall’s table.
